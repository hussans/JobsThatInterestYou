**Project Name**: Jobs That Interest You
<br/>
**Description**: This project is a simple website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It highlights five companies I’d like to work for, with details about why I’m interested in them, what skills I already have, what I’d need to learn, and the goals I’d have in each role. Each company includes a link to a real job posting.

**Review**: I really like the design of the site and I can tell that you took good reasearch into companies that you are interested in. I am excited to start applying for jobs like these and it looks like you are the right track to getting one, great job.
